Actually, the assignment isn't as scary as it seems. The hardest part is how my brain learns new information. It doesn't connect the theory to the practical straight away, so I did have to go over everything again. This is a me issue, and not an issue with the course, that is thoroughly enjoyable.

I have a foundation degree in counselling, and I thought that creating a page of techniques for anxiety could be helpful. Tie the familiar with the unfamiliar. The aim of the webpage was to be soothing and calming for the webpage users who were searching it out.

I titled the page "Just breath? We're here to show you how!" because I feel not everyone who has anxiety necessarily needs grounding and breathing techniques, and not everyone who needs them is not necessarily someone with anxiety. Afterall, we all get nervous from time to time and can benefit from grounding techniques.

The header, footer, and navigation settings have a calming cornflower blue shade, and I think the white writing matches it nicely whilst remaining visible. I thought a seamless header and navigation bar looked nice and calming.

The page title and navigation bar contain question marks because trying to tell someone who is having a panic attack to breathe never ends well and I can imagine their distaste. I believe that the content is understandable, it is a webpage designed to be educational, helpful, and calming. The navigation is connected to the webpage, so that if you click on them it will take you to that section of the page, for ease of movemet. I inserted a search bar because I wanted the user to be able to enter the section that they wanted into it and it would take it there for them, however I did have difficulty with that. I did keep the code for it included in the javascript, but I commented it out, because I know I will be able to fix it one day.

I feel the webpage is well organised, and I created it with the sections deliberately in that order. First things first, catch your breath, do some breathing exercises. Secondly, we'll work on the grounding, this helps both before the feelings of anxiety, and to help remove the user from them. Also good for people that dissociate from Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder. Lastly, we have the page on re-setting the parasympathetic nervous system. This is great to do after a panic arrack, and also during depending on the persons ability of control. This website is made in mind for people who want help before the discomfort starts, as well as for during. This is also important for why the navigation bar was connected to those links on the main page; so the information was easy to access.

I created a hover effect for the information over the images. I wanted the background images to be calming, and decided that if the user couldn't see all of the image then it wouldn't be very calming. When the curser hovers over the cta boxes they become more apparent to portray that that is an interactive part of the site.

I put on mp3file on the page, but I did not set it to play automatically because that defeated the point of the webpage. It is incredibly stressful when a weboage is opened and it starts to talk or play music, especially if multiple tags are open. Even unexpected bird song can be distressing to the right person.

As stated at the start, I struggled with everything, but only because my brain still hasn't linked both the practical and theoretical together. This just meant I spent more time researching how to do what I wanted to do, and what phrases meant.

I did consider creating a "back to top" button, but as the navigation bar moved as the page did, this seemed unnecessary for this page, but I do love a "back to top" button when a webpage does not have a navigation bar that follows as I go.

The clickable elements on the images weren't too obvious because they didn't appear to be more obvious than the cta box that they were already ontop of. I believe I could make it enlargen when the mouse hovers over it, and then it would be more obvious that it will link to the page of interest.

As mentioned previously, I struggled to make the search bar interactive with the page. I think I confused myself because I wasn't seeing what I wanted to do in the demo's I was looking at, both on youtube and google. I wanted the user to search the navigation headings and be taken to it through the search bar results, for example, if they searched ice, it would take them to that section. I know the navigation bar does a very good job of doing that but nevertheless!
Using the inspect tool on chrome I know what the issue is and where, I just didn't know how to rectify it for the information I had and was trying to create. There was an issue with an addeventlistener and it was returning null. I was using more of a database search because nothing I was searching for was what I wanted. This meant I was trying to put my data and my actions to fit into their example, and this is where I believe I confused myself. If I was trying to create a search identical to the one I was using for reference, I do believe that I would have been able to debug it myself.

Also, I had my work nicely indented, and then I would save it and it decided to change my indentations and create red spaces infront of them. I did not figure out how to stop that from happening because the code still works.

Despite the search-bar issue and going over everything again I did enjoy myself, and I do think I ticked off the requirements, and gave a very good reason why I did half of one requirement (the instant music player). I am good at finding issues with my code and de-bugging it, and it did not deter me, because that is coding, fixing an issue you created when you fixed an issue you created when you tried to fix something.
